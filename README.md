# Jamey McCabe's Proposed Improvements to Data Visualization
Udacity Nanodegree Data Visualization Project 2

The website at http://www.santafedatahub.org is a community service for Santa Fe NM and takes data about the youth of Santa Fe and turns them in trending and infomrative infomration for the betterment of society.

An example of such a graph is Disconnected Youth 16-24 in Santa Fe which can be found at: http://www.santafedatahub.org/disconnected-youth-ages-16-24.html.

Suggested Improvements to this graph are laid out in this dimple chart who's code can be found below.  teh Suggested improvements include:
1. Use of colors light and dark red of different hues to assit audience with color blindness.
2. Use of an area chart instead of multiple pie charts.  
- The population being examined is all the same and the area chart can show the relative size of the entire population by age and allow comparison of relative size of each age group.
- area chart provides a sense of the boundaries of the population via the white space around the colored part.  Shows that analysis is not depicting ages less than 16 or over 24.    
3. Elimination of a separate legend puting the labels for the Diconnected versus connected popluations right on the material.  Avoids eye travelling back and forth to the legend and possible confusion by the reader.
